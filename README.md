## To run Tests

```bash
$ npm run test

Note:
In the Figma design, some of the properties do have are more than 3 labels, so the rest of the labels after the 3rd label are hidden, and can only be seen through the + button.
BUT in the response of the API you have provided, all of the properties have less than or maximum 3 labels, so this behavior won't happen or be seen.
So I have manually added free wifi and free parking labels to all the properties manually in order to show this behavior too.
